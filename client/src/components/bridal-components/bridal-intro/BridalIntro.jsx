          The bridal makeup I do is more natural looking, bringing our your
          beauty to shine as big as the love in your heart. Like the look, all
          the products I will be using are natural as well. I only use clean,
          non toxic, high quality makeup to nurture your health as well as your
          beauty. I will make the makeup process a fun, stress free one. Leave
          all the planning up to me! Canâ€™t wait to be your supporter.
